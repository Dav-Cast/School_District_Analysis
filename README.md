# School_District_Analysis
Analysis on school's performance to uncover tendencies by filtering the shared school data. 

Some of the discoveries I had was how to join all the knowledge I gathered throughout the Module and the online sessions and a cool way to emphasize this, for example, is in when and how you can use the chaining method to create a code that could even fit in the same row. For example you should not use it when you want to save until a certain point of the modification the data or when you want to re-filter again for example in the last cell, first we grouped the data and then we wanted it to only show "math_score" but as it was not possible to do it in the same row we did it in the next one. You get to know this tiny aspects by actually working with the software and playing around a bit. And finally this challenge also allowed me to see the ETL process in action. After the data was extracted we proceeded to prepare it so we could work with it more efficiently or in other words we transformed it and at the end we loaded it for review.
